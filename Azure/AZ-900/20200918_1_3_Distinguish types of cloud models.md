#  Distinguish types of cloud models

## Learning objectives    

> - Understand public, private, and hybrid cloud models.
> - Decide which cloud deployment model is best for you.



## Define public cloud

- Characteristics of public cloud
  - __Ownership__
    - Ownership refers to the resources that an organization or end user uses.
    - Resources do not belong to the organization that is utilizing them, but rather they are owned and operated by a third party, such as the cloud service provider.
  - __Multiple and users__ - Public cloud modes may make their resources available to multiple organizations.
  - __Public access__ - Public access allows the public to access the desired cloud services.
  - __Availability__ - Public cloud is the most common cloud-type deployment model.
  - __Connectivity__ - Users and organizations are typically connected to the public cloud over the internet using a web browser.
  - __Skills__ - Public clouds do not require deep technical knowledge to set up and use its resources.
- With  a public cloud, there is no local hardware to manager or keep up to date; everything runs on the cloud provider's hardware.



## Define private cloud

- Characteristics of private cloud
  - __Ownership__ - The owner and user of the cloud services are the same.
  - __Hardware__ - The owner is entirely responsible for the purchase, maintenance, and management of the cloud hardware.
  - __Users__ - A private cloud operates only within one organization and cloud computing resources are used exclusively by a single business or organization.
  - __Connectivity__ - A connection to a private cloud is typically made over a private network that is highly secure.
  - __Public access__ - Does not provide access to the public.
  - __Skills__ - Requires deep technical knowledge to set up, manage, and maintain.
- A private cloud is owned and operated by the organization that uses the resources from that cloud.



## Define hybrid cloud

- Cloud service's characteristics and considerations
  - __High availability(고가용성)__
  - __Scalability(확장성)__ : Doesn't have to be done automatically.
  - __Elasticity(탄력성)__ : Is done automatically.
  - __Agility(민첩성)__
  - __Fault tolerance(내결함성)__
  - __Disaster recovery(재해복구)__
  - __Global reach(접근성)__
  - __Customer latency capabilities(고객 응답 지연)__
  - __Predictive cost considerations(예측 비용 고려사항)__
  - __Technical skill requirements and considerations(기술적 요구사항과 고려사항)__
  - __Increased productivity(향상된 생산성)__
  - __Security(보안성)__



## Discuss economies of scale

- Characteristics of hybrid cloud
  - __Resource location__ - Specific resource run or are used in a public cloud, and others run or are used in a private cloud.
  - __Cost and efficiency__ - Hybrid cloud models allow an organization to leverage some of the benefits of cost, efficiency, and scale that are available with a public cloud model.
  - __Control__ - Organizations retain management control in private clouds.
  - __Skills__ - Technical skills are still required to maintain the private cloud and ensure both cloud models can operate together.
- A hybrid cloud combines both public and private clouds, allowing you to run your applications in the most appropriate location.



## Compare cloud models

| Type              | Advantages                                                   | Disadvantages                                                |
